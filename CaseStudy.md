Recommendations
If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
I would suggest a free course or at least tutorial done directly by them, as it is one of the harder to use pool protocols.

Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
They already offer an amazing product but its not user friendly so it would increase their user count by huge numbers.

What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Youtube

Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
They would work as visual aids or tutorials on how to use the applications.
